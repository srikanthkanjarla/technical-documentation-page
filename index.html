                <p> It will also teach you how to manipulate and access the data within Javascript objects, using both dot and
                    bracket notation.When you're done with this section, you should understand the basic properties and differences
                    between arrays and objects, as well as how to choose which to use for a given purpose</p>

                    <h2> Storing a Collection of Data</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. This is known as a one-dimensional
                    array, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice
                    it contains
                    <i class="highlight">booleans</i>,
                    <i class="highlight">strings</i>, and
                    <i class="highlight">numbers</i>, among other valid JavaScript data types:</p>
                <code>
                    let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three’, true, false, undefined, null]; 
                    console.log(simpleArray.length); 
                    //logs 7
                </code>
                <p>All array's have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax
                    <span
                        class="highlight">Array.length</span>
                </p>
                <p>A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is known as a multi-dimensional array,
                    or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript objects, which
                    we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are
                    also capable of storing complex objects.</p>
                <code>
                    let complexArray = [ 
                                         [ 
                                          { one: 1, two: 2 }, 
                                          { three: 3, four: 4 } 
                                         ], 
                                         [ 
                                          { a: "a", b: "b" }, 
                                          { c: "c", d: “d”} 
                                         ]

                <header>
                    <h2>Bracket notation to access content</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be
                    able to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, let's begin
                    to think about how we can access that array's information.</p>
                <p>When we define a simple array as seen below, there are 3 items in it:</p>
                <code>
                    let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
                </code>
                <p>
                    In an array, each array item has an index. This index doubles as the position of that item in the array, and how you reference
                    it. However, it is important to note, that JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first
                    element of an array is actually at the
                    <b>zeroth</b> position, not the first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or
                    more commonly, to a variable which references an array object. This is known as
                    <i>bracket notation</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if we want to retrieve the
                    <span class="highlight">"a"</span> from
                    <span class="highlight">ourArray</span> and assign it to a variable, we can do so with the following code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let ourVariable = ourArray[0]; 
                    // ourVariable equals "a"
                </code>
                <p>
                    In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation:
                </p>
                <code>
                    ourArray[1] = "not b anymore";
                    // ourArray now equals ["a", "not b anymore", "c"];
                </code>
                <p>
                    Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from
                    <span class="highlight">"b"</span>, to
                    <span class="highlight">"not b anymore"</span> .
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Array's_push()_and_unshift()_methods">
                <header>
                    <h2>Array's push() and unshift() methods</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of
                    elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this
                    challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array:
                    <span class="highlight">Array.push()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">Array.unshift()</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the
                    <span class="highlight">push()</span> method adds elements to the end of an array, and
                    <span class="highlight">unshift()</span> adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let twentyThree = 'XXIII'; 
                    let romanNumerals = ['XXI', 'XXII']; 
                    romanNumerals.unshift('XIX', 'XX'); 
                    // now equals ['XIX','XX', 'XXI', 'XXII'] 
                    romanNumerals.push(twentyThree); 
                    // now equals ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII', 'XXIII']
                </code>
                <p>
                    Notice that we can also pass variables, which allows us even greater flexibility in dynamically modifying our array's data.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Array's_pop()_and_shift()_methods">
                <header>
                    <h2>
                        Array's pop() and shift() methods
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Both
                    <span class="highlight">push()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">unshift()</span> have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites:
                    <span class="highlight">pop()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">shift()</span>. As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding,
                    <span class="highlight">pop()</span> removes an element from the end of an array, while
                    <span class="highlight">shift()</span> removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between
                    <span class="highlight">pop()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">shift()</span> and their cousins
                    <span class="highlight">push()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">unshift()</span>, is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified
                    by a single element at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    let's take a look:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!']; 
                    greetings.pop(); 
                    // now equals ['whats up?', 'hello'] greetings.shift();
                    // now equals ['hello']
                </code>
                <p>
                    We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let popped = greetings.pop(); 
                    // returns 'hello'
                    // greetings now equals []
                </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Remove_items_using_splice()">
                <header>
                    <h2>Remove items using splice()</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using
                    <span class="highlight">shift()</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">pop()</span>, but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than
                    one element at once? Well, that's where
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> comes in.
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in
                    an array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first
                    two parameters of
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first
                    element of an array, we would use 0.
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span>'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements,
                    while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];
                    array.splice(2, 2); 
                    // remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
                    // array now equals ['today', 'was', 'great']
                </code>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing
                    the value of the removed elements:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy']; 
                    let newArray = array.splice(3, 2); 
                    // newArray equals ['really', 'happy']
                </code>
            </section>

                    Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> can take up to three parameters? Well, we can go one step further with
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> — in addition to removing elements, we can use that third parameter, which represents
                    one or more elements, to add them as well
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. For instance, let's
                    say you're storing a color scheme for a set of DOM elements in an array, and want to dynamically change
                    a color based on some action:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) { 
                        arr.splice(index, 1, newColor); 
                        return arr; 
                    } 
                    let colorScheme = ['#878787','#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];
                     colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327'); 
                     //we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place 
                     // colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794','#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
                </code>
                <p>
                    This function takes an array of hex values, an index at which to remove an element, and the new color to replace the removed
                    element with. The return value is an array containing a newly modified color scheme! While this example
                    is a bit oversimplified, we can see the value that utilizing
                    <span class="highlight">splice()</span> to its maximum potential can have.

                <p>The next method we will cover is
                    <span class="highlight">slice()</span>. rather than modifying an array, copies, or extracts, a given number of elements to a
                    new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched.
                    <span class="highlight">slice()</span> takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the
                    second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element
                    at this index). Consider this:</p>
                <code>
                    let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']; 
                    let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
                     //todaysWeather equals ['snow', 'sleet'];
                     // weatherConditions still equals ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail','clear']
                </code>
                <p>
                    In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

                        While
                        <span class="highlight">slice()</span> allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other
                        useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order,
                        with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this:
                        <span class="highlight">...</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null]; 
                        let thatArray = [...thisArray]; 
                        // thatArray equals [true, true, undefined,false,null] 
                        // thisArray remains unchanged, and is identical to thatArray
                    </code>

                <p>
                    Another huge advantage of the spread operator, is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array
                    into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only
                    allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following
                    operation extremely simple:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme']; 
                    let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
                    // thatArray now equals ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander']
                </code>
                <p>
                    Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more more complex and more verbose had we used
                    traditional methods.

                <p>Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece
                    of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, JavaScript provides
                    us with another built-in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence
                    of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the
                    position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <code>
                    let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears']; 
                    fruits.indexOf('dates')   // returns -1 
                    fruits.indexOf('oranges') // returns 2 
                    fruits.indexOf('pears')   // returns 1, the first index at which the element exists

                <p>
                    Sometimes when working with arrays, it is very handy to be able to iterate through each item to find one or more elements
                    that we might need, or to manipulate an array based on which data items meet a certain set of criteria.
                    JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in slightly different ways to
                    achieve different results (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.), however the technique which is most
                    flexible and offers us the greatest amount of control is a simple for loop.

                </p>
                <p> Consider the following:
                </p>

                    At their most basic, objects are just collections of key-value pairs, or in other words, pieces of data mapped to unique
                    identifiers that we call properties or keys. Let's take a look at a very simple example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let FCC_User = { username: 'awesome_coder', followers: 572, points: 1741, completedProjects: 15 };
                </code>
                <p>
                    The above code defines an object called
                    <span class="highlight">FCC_User</span> that has four properties, each of which map to a specific value. If we wanted to know
                    the number of
                    <span class="highlight">followers FCC_User</span> has, we can access that property by writing: has, we can access that property
                    by writing:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let userData = FCC_User.followers; 
                    // userData equals 572
                </code>
                <p>This is called
                    <i>dot notation</i>. Alternatively, we can also access the property with brackets, like so:</p>
                <code>
                    let userData = FCC_User['followers'] 
                    // userData equals 572
                </code>
                <p>
                    Notice that with bracket notation, we enclosed
                    <span class="highlight">followers</span> in quotes. This is because the brackets actually allow us to pass a variable in to be
                    evaluated as a property name (hint: keep this in mind for later!). Had we passed
                    <span class="highlight">followers</span> in without the quotes, the JavaScript engine would have attempted to evaluate it as
                    a variable, and a
                    <span class="highlight">ReferenceError: followers is not defined</span> would have been thrown.

                <p>
                    Now let's take a look at a slightly more complex object. Object properties can be nested to an arbitrary depth, and their
                    values can be any type of data supported by JavaScript, including arrays and even other objects. Consider
                    the following:

                <code>
                    let nestedObject = { id: 28802695164,

                                                }
                                        };
                </code>
                <p>
                    nestedObject has three unique keys:
                    <span class="highlight">id</span>, whose value is a number,
                    <span class="highlight">date</span> whose value is a string, and
                    <span class="highlight">data</span>, whose value is an object which has yet another object nested within it. While structures
                    can quickly become complex, we can still use the same notations to access the information we need.

                <p>
                    In the first object challenge we mentioned the use of bracket notation as a way to access property values using the evaluation
                    of a variable. For instance, imagine that our
                    <span class="highlight">foods</span> object is being used in a program for a supermarket cash register. We have some function
                    that sets the
                    <span class="highlight">selectedFood</span> and we want to check our
                    <span class="highlight">foods</span> object for the presence of that food. This might look like:
                </p>
                <code>
                    let selectedFood = getCurrentFood(scannedItem); 
                    let inventory = foods[selectedFood];

                </code>
                <p>
                    This code will evaluate the value stored in the
                    <span class="highlight">selecteFood</span> variable and return the value of that key in the
                    <span class="highlight">foods</span> object, or
                    <span class="highlight">undefined</span> if it is not present. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties
                    are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.

                        Now you know what objects are and their basic features and advantages. In short, they are key-value stores which provide
                        a flexible, intuitive way to structure data,
                        <b>and</b>, they provide very fast lookup time. Throughout the rest of these challenges, we will describe
                        several common operations you can perform on objects so you can become comfortable applying these
                        useful data structures in your programs.

                        <span class="highlight">delete</span> delete keyword like this:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        delete foods.apples;
                    </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Object's_hasOwnProperty()_method">
                <header>
                    <h2>Object's hasOwnProperty() method</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Now we can add, modify, and remove keys from objects. But what if we just wanted to know if an object has a specific property?
                    JavaScript provides us with two different ways to do this. One uses the
                    <span class="highlight">hasOwnProperty()</span> method and the other uses the
                    <span class="highlight">in</span> keyword. If we have an object users with a property of
                    <span class="highlight">Alan</span>, we could check for its presence in either of the following ways:
                </p>
                <code>
                    users.hasOwnProperty('Alan'); 
                    'Alan' in users; // both return true
                </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Using_for...in_with_objects">
                <header>
                    <h2>
                        Using for...in with objects
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you may need to iterate through all the keys within an object. This requires a specific syntax in JavaScript called
                    a for...in statement. For our
                    <span class="highlight">users</span> object, this could look like:
                </p>
                <code>
                    for (let user in users) { 
                        console.log(user); 
                    } 
                    // logs: Alan Jeff Sarah Ryan
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this statement, we defined a variable
                    <span class="highlight">user</span>, and as you can see, this variable was reset during each iteration to each of the object's
                    keys as the statement looped through the object, resulting in each user's name being printed to the console.
                </p>
                <h3>NOTE:</h3>
                <p>

                    Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a keys position on an object, or the relative order
                    in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.
                </p>
            </section>
        
            <section class="main-section" id="Object.keys()_method">
                <header>
                    <h2>
                        Object.keys() method
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    We can also generate an array which contains all the keys stored in an object using the
                    <span class="highlight">Object.keys()</span> method and passing in an object as the argument. This will return an array with
                    strings representing each property in the object. Again, there will be no specific order to the entries
                    in the array.
